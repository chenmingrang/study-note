回滚
   Before executing an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement, the database marks an implicit savepoint (unavailable to you). 
   If the statement fails, the database rolls back to the savepoint. 

If you exit a stored subprogram with an unhandled exception, 
PL/SQL does not assign values to OUT parameters, and does not do any rollback.
